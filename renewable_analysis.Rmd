-   **China**'s renewable energy expansion, accelerated during the post-pandemic recovery, is expected to maintain momentum as the nation positions clean energy technologies as central to its net-zero transition strategy. Despite coal's continued dominance in the electricity mix, China's strategic shift toward sophisticated hybrid renewable installations and 24/7 clean energy projects will be critical for meeting anticipated power demand growth, which is forecasted to align with the country's projected 4.3% GDP expansion[\*](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/infrastructure-project-finance/apac-power-renewable-projects-outlook-2025-06-12-2024).

-   **Africa** and **the Middle East** invest far less in absolute terms, yet both regions show a noticeable upward trajectory from 2020 onward, especially Africa.

-   In **North America**, the increase in clean energy investment was largely by major **US** policy initiatives. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act committed approximately USD 550bn toward modernising infrastructure and advancing clean energy development, while the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, allocated another USD 370bn to support energy transition efforts and strengthen climate resilience[\*](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2024/united-states).

-   **Asia-Pacific** saw stagnant investment until 2021, followed by a strong surge — reflecting post-COVID economic stimulus packages and regional infrastructure ramp-ups in renewables.

-   **Europe** shows strong, consistent growth — a result of multiple reinforcing forces:

    -   Russia's invasion of Ukraine exposed Europe's critical vulnerability to energy supply disruptions, accelerating policy initiatives toward energy independence and renewable alternatives.

    -   Record wind energy investments in 2023 (EUR 30bn)[\*](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/record-year-wind-farms-raises-hope-eu-green-energy-goals-2024-02-27/).

    -   Massive EU industrial policy support (e.g., NZIA, RePower, EU's target "to achieve a minimum of 42.5% of its energy consumption from renewable sources by 2030[\*](https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/97e481fd-2dc3-412d-be4c-f152a8232961_en?filename=The%20future%20of%20European%20competitiveness%20_%20A%20competitiveness%20strategy%20for%20Europe.pdf).)

-   The global total mirrors the macro trends of its largest contributors, with a clear inflection point in 2021, reflecting collective global shifts toward clean energy in response to energy crises, net-zero targets, and green stimulus policies.
